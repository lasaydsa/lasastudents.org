# STUDENTS UNITED

Building a progressive, democratic, and representative <br/>LASA that **puts students first**.

We're forming a union to collectively bargain over working conditions and we need your support, if you're a student at LASA, [please sign your union authorization card today.](https://tally.so/r/mRJyDQ)

To get involved in the effort, please join us at our meetings every Tuesday in G104 (DiGioia) at lunch, we'd love to see you there.

## Our platform

We believe LASA is **actively harming our students and teachers** through **willful negligence** around workloads, mental health care, and stress levels.

This is supported through the **college rat race** and a **grades-based social hierarchy** encouraged by the vicious feedback loop of parents and administration.

Teachers are then expected to **work many hours on weekends and nights** to grade work ASAP to **maintain the social hierarchy.**

**This must end**, and we must have a community school that **puts students first** with a **union culture.**

We believe that **students** are capable of **building power** through **organizing students, community leaders and parents.**

We believe that **strong, independent democratic institutions** are critical to building student power.

We believe that we can build a **healthier, less stressful and safer work environment** through **collective bargaining with administrators.**
